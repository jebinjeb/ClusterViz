# ClusterViz

- ClusterViz is a powerful tool designed to provide visualization capabilities for Kubernetes (K8s) pod scheduling and storage placement. With ClusterViz, you can gain a comprehensive view of your Kubernetes clusters and easily understand how pods are scheduled across the cluster's nodes and how storage resources are allocated.


## Features 
- visualization for pod placement: CloudViz provides visualizations that help you understand how pods are distributed across nodes in your cluster. It allows you to see the placement of pods on different nodes, enabling you to optimize resource utilization and identify any imbalances or bottlenecks.
  
- visualization for storage replication & Storage Source
  
- visualization for pod security & rbac: CloudViz includes visualizations that focus on pod security and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). These visualizations help you assess the security posture of your pods and identify any potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. Additionally, it provides insights into RBAC policies and permissions, allowing you to review and analyze the access controls in your cluster.

## Addional Features:
- Cluster Overview: CloudViz offers an overview of your entire cluster, providing a high-level visualization of the nodes, pods, services, and other resources. It allows you to quickly grasp the overall health and status of your cluster.
- Resource Utilization: CloudViz provides visualizations that help you monitor and analyze the resource utilization of your cluster, including CPU, memory, and storage. These visualizations enable you to identify resource-intensive workloads, optimize resource allocation, and prevent resource bottlenecks.
- Network Topology: CloudViz offers a network topology view that displays the connections and communication patterns between different pods and services in your cluster. It helps you understand the network architecture and dependencies, allowing you to troubleshoot networking issues and optimize network performance.
- Application Dependency Mapping: CloudViz allows you to visualize the dependencies between applications and services running in your cluster. It helps you identify the relationships and interactions between different components, facilitating troubleshooting, impact analysis, and understanding of application dependencies.
