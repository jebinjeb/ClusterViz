# ClusterViz

- ClusterViz is a powerful tool designed to provide visualization capabilities for Kubernetes (K8s) pod scheduling and storage placement. With ClusterViz, you can gain a comprehensive view of your Kubernetes clusters and easily understand how pods are scheduled across the cluster's nodes and how storage resources are allocated.

- By leveraging intuitive visualizations, ClusterViz enables you to observe and analyze the distribution and placement of pods within your Kubernetes infrastructure. This visualization can help you identify potential inefficiencies, optimize resource allocation, and ensure that your workloads are distributed appropriately across the cluster.

- Additionally, ClusterViz offers insights into storage placement, allowing you to visualize how persistent volumes and storage resources are allocated to pods. This feature aids in optimizing storage utilization and ensuring that storage resources are efficiently allocated based on the requirements of your applications.

- By providing a clear and interactive representation of pod scheduling and storage placement, ClusterViz empowers you to make informed decisions, enhance cluster performance, and improve resource utilization within your Kubernetes environment.
